A car has properties like weight and color, and methods like start and stop:

Properties			Methods

car.name = Fiat			car.start()

car.model = 500			car.drive()

car.weight = 850kg		car.brake()

car.color = white		car.stop()
All cars have the same properties, but the property values differ from car to car.

All cars have the same methods, but the methods are performed at different times.
